# Reverse an Array

The challenge was to take an array and display it in reverse form without using outsourced methods. 

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficency

This challenge was a collaborative effort in class, and for the constraints given, the best way to execute it is in the above solution. The whiteboard process itself was one that requires you to ask questions and target the problem domain to the exact needs of the interviewer and to help you see where you need to start to get the desired outcome. I think this is a great approach, because you are forced to attack the problem in bite-sized segments and think beyond the easy route to find your own efficent solution. 

In order to reverse the array without using methods there needs to be a way to loop through the index and swap places of the inital and last element encroaching on the middle of the array and stopping once the last elemnts have been shifted. This does alter the original array, but that is something that you would ensure is okay with the person issuing the problem to you along with other guidelines during the problem domain. Things are pretty clear cut once the psuedo code has been written.
