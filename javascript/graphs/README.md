# Graph

A database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data.

## Challenge
Create a Graph class that is represented as an adjacency list.

## Approach & Efficiency
The efficiency for the Graph has an O(n) depending on its vertex's root. The space is O(n) with a created set that contains all respective nodes visited. 


## API
| Method    | Argument | Binary Tree                                                                                                  |
|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| addNode()  | N/A      | Add a node to the graph                                                           |
| addEdge()   | N/A      | Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph                                                                 |
| getNodes) | N/A      | Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar) |
| getNeighbors() | N/A  | Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node|
| size() | N/A | Returns the total number of nodes in the graph |
