# Array binary search challenge

This challenge consists of a function that takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to JavaScript, I had to return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.
